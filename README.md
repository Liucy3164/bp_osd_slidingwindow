BP-OSD decoding with sliding window for QLDPC codes modified from open source [[1]] and trying to reproduce [[2]] by adding sliding window and measurement errors.

I generated sliding window source code and provide an sliding window example code for [[625, 25, 8]] LDPC code lifetime versus error rate. 

Replace source code css_decode_sim.py in [[1]] and try my current new example code for sliding window performances. One could add more data points for better visualizations.
